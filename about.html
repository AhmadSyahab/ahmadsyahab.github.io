				<h3>Unofficial DotA Role</h3>
				<h4> Hard Carry </h4>
				<p>
					The term "hard carry" refers to a type of carry hero who is especially reliant on the acquisition of items to function effectively, as opposed to "softer" carries that gain substantial damage from abilities and as such do not require gold to be dangerous. Hard carries are generally equipped with abilities which scale very closely with their items, meaning that when they do not have farm their abilities are weak. Hard carries cannot have farm early in the game, so they are generally paired in lanes with disabling support heroes, whose powerful early game abilities counterbalance the horribly weak hard carry's. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					As a hard carry attains gold and levels, they will progressively become more dangerous, and generally reach their period of maximum relative effectiveness later in the game than other heroes - meaning that the hard carry will have a huge advantage if the game goes for long enough. As a rule, the more reliant a carry is on items to function directly correlates with how effective they are once they have them - for instance, Anti-Mage with three carry items in his inventory will be stronger than a Medusa with the same amount, but when six items are in play, Medusa will make much better use of them than Anti-Mage - this means that she is a harder carry than he. 
				</p>
				<h4> Semi-Carry </h4>
				<p>
					Semi-carries are heroes that, like hard carries, are skilled at killing enemy heroes. Unlike hard carries, however, they do not require very much farm to do so, and are generally most dependent on levels, so they usually lane in the middle lane to amass them as rapidly as possible. They tend to be most dominant in the midgame, before either their own or the enemy's true carry has amassed enough farm to supersede them. A successful game for a semi-carry involves asserting map control and impeding the enemy carry's farm, which in turn allows for their own carry to safely amass items. The "Semi-Carry", although long acknowledged in the community, is not a role recognized by Valve, likely because of the high ambiguity in defining the role.
				</p>
				<p>
					If they are doing well, a semi-carry may have respectable attack damage depending on the hero being played - and all semi-carries will scale at least moderately well with items. However, by the end of the middle game period, semi-carries typically transition into a more supportive role. This is not to say that they play Support; this is simply the point where their damage and capabilities are outstripped by "hard" carries. To amend their damage "falling off" (as it is called), they often build items such as Heaven's Halberd, Assault Cuirass , and Scythe of Vyse to provide utility instead of their ailing damage. 
				</p>
				<h4> Ganker </h4>
				<p>
					Gankers are heroes with abilities that deliver long duration crowd control and/or immense damage in the early and midgame. They tend to have good mobility and rely on a mixture of physical and magical damage as well as disables to bring down their enemies. Their goal is to give the team an early game advantage during the laning phase by killing enemy heroes in their proper lanes. The Ganker role is often synonymous with the semi-carry role, as most Gankers become semi-carries if they are successful in their efforts, owing to a large gold and level advantage. However, because their abilities do not scale as well, they will usually suffer more in the late game (hence the need for a hard carry). Nevertheless, if a Ganker performs extremely well, they might prove to be the overall bigger threat to the enemy team at the game's conclusion than an allied hard carry. The most important task for a Ganker is to restrict the farm and levels of the opposing carry. 
				</p>
				<h4> Roamer </h4>
				<p>
					"Can focus on moving around the map instead of farming creeps early in the game." . Always support heroes, the main goal of Roamers is to gain as much map control as possible early in the game by warding, ganking and studying the location of missing heroes. They are also responsible for creep pulling, creep stacking (for the purpose of helping a fellow Jungler or to be the source of farm) and most crucially shutting down enemy Junglers. They often attempt to gank the enemy's mid hero, a difficult feat (albeit a very rewarding one) which usually requires a long-range disables and/or a Smoke of Deceit.  
				</p>
				<h4> Offlaner </h4>
				<p>
					Offlane heroes are those with abilities that allow them to solo the "suicide lane" (top lane for Radiant, bottom lane for Dire). Having an offlaner in a team's lineup allows the team to also have a Jungler or run a tri-lane with less risk of losing the suicide lane to the opposing lane. In many cases, the offlaner may have to forgo a great deal of farm in order to simply stay alive, and as such may be on the back foot much of the time. Heroes with the ability to escape from certain death are best suited to this role, as the offlaner's first priority should be to not die in lane. Against skilled opponents, the offlaner may be extremely under-leveled compared to other heroes on the field, and as such it is generally unwise to put a hard carry in the offlane because they may not get enough farm to obtain the items they need to snowball into the late-game.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally speaking, heroes that can excel in the offlane and still be effective throughout the game have at least one of these qualities: 
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A skillset that allows them to escape from ganks safely. See Escape.</li>
						<li>They are able to secure a reasonable amount of farm despite the possibility of being forced out of lane.</li>
						<li>They have abilities that will keep them alive in the early-game as well as allowing them to be effective in the mid-game despite a lack of gold. Supports such as Tidehunter and Windranger are examples of this. This can include heroes whose abilities have a great deal of utility later on in the game. For instance, abilities like Mirana Mirana's Moonlight Shadow and Earth Spirit Geomagnetic Grip can serve to benefit other teammates as well as the player in a variety of scenarios.</li>
						<li>They are able to disrupt the enemy carry's farm. Good use of summons like Lone Druid Spirit Bear can position friendly creeps in a place where the carry may struggle to get last hits, such as under a friendly tower from where you can deny them safely.</li>
					</ol>

				<h3>Heroes Type</h3>
				<h4>Agility Heroes</h4>
				<p>
					Agility attribute is the attribute that grants armor and attack speed. Additionally, agility heroes also get 1 attack damage per agility point. To gain exactly 1 armor, 7 agility points are required. 
				</p>	
				<p>
					Because Agility heroes are the only class of heroes to gain both damage and attack speed as their primary attribute increases, they tend to have the highest physical damage output as the game progresses. This makes them scale very well with offensive items. They tend to have limited disabling capabilities or nukes; almost all their abilities augment their physical capabilities or serve as positioning or escape mechanisms. This tends to make them much more vulnerable and weak in the early game when strong offensive disables and nukes dictate the flow of kills, but also means that, with good items under their belts, they will be the ones delivering the greatest amount of damage in the late game, while also being dealt the least amount of physical damage as a result of their high armor. Agility heroes have a roughly even split between being melee or being ranged, and fit primarily into carry and ganker roles.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the moment, there are 36 Agility Heroes implemented in Dota 2.
				</p>
				<h4>Intelligence Heroes</h4>
				<p>
					Intelligence is the attribute that grants mana, mana regeneration and spell damage amplification. Additionally, intelligence heroes also get 1 attack damage per intelligence point. To gain 1 mana regeneration, 25 intelligence points are required, and to gain 1% spell damage, 14 intelligence points are required. The mana increase only applies to the maximum mana, the hero's current mana is not increased by 11. The current mana percentage stays unchanged upon gaining intelligence.  
				</p>	
				<p>
					Intelligence heroes tend to have a greater number of active abilities compared to heroes of other classes; all Intelligence heroes have at least three active abilities, with a large number of them having all four of their abilities being actives. Their larger mana pools and higher mana regen rates go a long way to help them use these abilities frequently. As a whole, Intelligence heroes have by far the greatest number of disabling capabilities, making them essential in most lineups. The items they build also tend to be highly caster based, since those items primarily provide Intelligence. With the exceptions of Dark Seer and Ogre Magi, all Intelligence heroes are ranged. Because most Intelligence heroes have abilities such as static damage nukes that scale poorly, they tend to have a strong early game, when enemies' health pools are low, but a much weaker late game, when enemies have high health and strong defensive items. Because of this, they often fit into support and ganker roles. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the moment, there are 40 Intelligence Heroes implemented in Dota 2. 
				</p>
				<h4>Strength Heroes</h4>
				<p>
					Strength is the attribute that grants health and health regeneration. Additionally, strength heroes also get 1 attack damage per strength point. To gain 1 health regeneration, 17 strength points are required. The health increase only applies to the maximum health, the hero's current health is not increased by 20. The current health percentage stays unchanged upon gaining strength. 
				</p>	
				<p>
					Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than heroes of other classes, making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells. Strength heroes have the greatest variety in their roles, including that of carry, ganker, and support, but almost all of them have some form of strong initiation and are supposed to act as tanks to some degree. In addition, heroes with a large amount of strength may greatly increase the damage needed to bring a team down. With the exception of Huskar, Io, Phoenix and Dragon Knight in his Elder Dragon Form, all strength heroes are melee. Whilst Intelligence heroes typically sport a strong early game, and Agility heroes excel in the late game, Strength heroes are often able to strike a balance between the two and remain relevant at all points of the game. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the moment, there are 37 Strength Heroes implemented in Dota 2.
